### Presentations

#### *Making the LINCS: Connecting gene mutations to new treatments with help from R and Bioconductor*

by Eric Kort

Large repositories of data describing how both drugs and disease affect cells have opened a new approach to medicine: matching diseases with treatments on the genetic level.  In this talk, we will hear how existing and new tools built with R are being used to mine the LINCS data repository created by the National Institutes of Health to give new hope to patients with genetically based diseases.
