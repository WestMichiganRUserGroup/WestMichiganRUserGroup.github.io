### Visualizations for Non-trivial Linear Models

Classroom examples and problems for most users of statistics seldom go
beyond a simple two factor fixed effects linear model while real
research is more often a mixture of fixed and random effects as well
as continuous covariates. Statisticians readily work with these more
advanced models, but researchers, particularly graduate students
outside of statistics generally need help understanding what these
statistical models are telling them. Visualizations greatly aid in
understanding interactions, fixed versus random effects and the
interplay between continuous and categorical factors. We will look at
a couple of examples of models from the GVSU Biomechanics lab and how
visualizations in R have helped graduate students in the Physical Therapy
program to understand their data.
