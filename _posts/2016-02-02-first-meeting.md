Join us to kick off the West Michigan R Users Group. We will be viewing recordings of the Rstudio Essentials programming webinars. Both new R programmers and experts should find useful hints both in the webinars and in the group discussions. Pizza will also be provided.

RStudio Programming

- Part 1: Writing code in RStudio
- Part 2: Debugging code in RStudio
- Part 3: Package writing in RStudio

Note there is a parking permit for the Seward Ramp west of DeVos Center in our files section (under the ellipsis in the menu bar) as well as a map of the GVSU Pew Campus. We will be in room 107D of DeVos Center (#6D) on the map.
