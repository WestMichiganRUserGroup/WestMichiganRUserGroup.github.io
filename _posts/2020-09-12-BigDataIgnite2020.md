## Presentation: Tuesday, 9/15 at Noon

**Predictive Maintenance Pipeline Using R**

Presenter: Nagdev Amruthnath

 Co-Sponsored by:

*West Michigan R Users Group*

Abstract:

The manufacturing industry is currently going through its fourth industrial revolution with advancements in quality, computer vision, safety, and maintenance. Among these advancements, predictive maintenance is seen as the magical unicorn for achieving a competitive edge and significantly improving efficiency. In a study by PWC, it is estimated that by implementing predictive maintenance, manufacturing industries could reduce cost by 12 percent, improve uptime by 9 percent, reduce various risks by 14 percent and extend the life of the machine by 20 percent. In this presentation, we introduce predictive maintenance, build predictive models using R, and deploy them in a production environment.
