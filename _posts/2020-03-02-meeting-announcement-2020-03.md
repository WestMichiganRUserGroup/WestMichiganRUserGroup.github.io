### Big Data Hubris: Limitations in Aggregating Uber and Google Data

_By Thomas Weinandy, Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at Western Michigan University_

Big data hubris is the belief that big data sets are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis. Thomas will share how his understanding of big data has evolved during his economics research and why 273 million Uber trips is not considered “big” enough. He will also discuss lessons learned from the rise and fall of Google Flu Trends.

### Lightning Talk: Migrating CRAN Packages After R Upgrades

_By Paul Egeler, M.S., GStat, Spectrum Health Office of Research and Education_

This will be an interactive dialogue on how to best migrate packages from
previous versions of R into the new R environment after a system upgrade. Paul
will discuss common strategies found online as well as his own approach.
