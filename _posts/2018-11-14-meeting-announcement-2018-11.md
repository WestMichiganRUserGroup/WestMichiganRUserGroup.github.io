### Presentations

#### *Iteration: Will it go round in circles?*

by Dr. David Zeitler

Long time R users know that we never use `for` loops except as a last resort. Most of us have learned to use and create vectorized code and (rarely) use the powerful built in `apply` iterator functions. These are equivalents of the container class iterator functions that have made C++, Java, Python and other languages much more robust. They are elegant and obtuse, making their use difficult at best. (I got a song that ainâ€™t got no melody...) The introduction of the `purrr` package from the team at RStudio makes those `apply` functions clearer and easier to use. (Apologies to Billy Preston!)
