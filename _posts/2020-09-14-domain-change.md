We would like to announce that WMRUG has purchased
[wmrug.org](https://wmrug.org) and [wmrug.club](https://wmrug.club) and are now
hosting this blog there!

You may still access the blog at <https://WestMichiganRUserGroup.github.io/>
since we are still hosting the blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
However, we felt that <https://WestMichiganRUserGroup.github.io/> was a little
bit of a mouthful so wanted to provide you with a shorter URL for your
convenience.

Please let us know if you'd like to hear a presentation about hosting static sites
using Github Pages and/or building blogs using Jekyll or
[Blogdown](https://blogdown.org/). We'd love to hear from you about that or any
other presentation ideas in the [forum](/forum/)!

The WMRUG team
