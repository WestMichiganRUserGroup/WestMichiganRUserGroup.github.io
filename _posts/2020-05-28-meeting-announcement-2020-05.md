### Improved Machine Learning with Kedro & MLflow

Hosted by
Elliott J. R. Church

__Presenter__: Michael Bloem, PhD, will explain and demonstrate the Kedro & MLflow
machine-learning frameworks.


[Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and 
[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) are relatively new open
source software packages that can make the development & deployment of
machine learning models (and the data pipelines that support them) more
robust, reproducible, & collaborative. In this talk, I will introduce
these software packages and describe how they can provide 
[complementary functionality](https://medium.com/@QuantumBlack/deploying-and-versioning-data-
pipelines-at-scale-942b1d81b5f5). I will then demonstrate their use from
soup to nuts (e.g., from a CSV or database to an API model deployment).
Time permitting, I will discuss how pipelines in Python's [scikit-learn
package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.
Pipeline.html) can provide additional complementary functionality that
facilitates model deployment.
