### Presentations

#### *Graph and workflow plotting with R*

By [Derek Nedveck](http://dnedveck.com)

Over at my place of employment, we've been working on defining our process / workflow. Part of this work is creating a visual representation of our workflow. Currently the visualization is done in Visio (or some other gross, non-scriptable program), but I figured this would be better suited to automated means, especially when I found out that our dept was already using something called a [RACI table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix). So this is my excuse to take a naive dive into workflow plotting.

I'm likely going to be getting into the `grid` graphics engine, and `DiagrammeR` ... or not, the only thing that's for sure is that I'll have gifs.
