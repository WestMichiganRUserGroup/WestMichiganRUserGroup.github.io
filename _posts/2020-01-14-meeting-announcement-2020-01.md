_Updated 2020-01-21_

We apologize for the late notice. However, due to an error in coordinating, the
January meeting scheduled for Tuesday, 2020-01-21 has been **rescheduled** for
Tuesday, 2020-02-18. We are sorry for the confusion.

The room is still available to our group. So if people want to get together to
discuss R or work on some data together, we can still have an informal meeting.
If you are interested, please reply on the Forum so that others are sure to attend.

Otherwise, we look forward to seeing you all in February!
