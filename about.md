This is a place for anyone interested in the open source statistical software R and its associated tools and variations such as RStudio, ShinyR, Revolutions R Open, SparkR and others. R is one of the fastest growing tools in the data scientist's toolbox providing visualization and statistical analysis capability. We will discuss R programming, statistical techniques using R, finding help with R, R packages (add-ons) and more.
