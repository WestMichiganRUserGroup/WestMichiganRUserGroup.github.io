<p>This blog post is a supplement to the West Michigan R User Group
<a href="/meeting/2020/03/02/meeting-announcement-2020-03.html">March 2020 Meeting</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that sometimes after upgrading to a new version of
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, you need to install all of your packages
again. This happens because the new install of R can’t find the location of the
old packages. Even if it could, it would still be a good idea to rebuild all of
your packages because packages are built for specific versions of R. So
sometimes a package built for one version will need to be rebuilt for another.
I’m leaving out a lot of details here, but that is the gist of it.</p>

<p>When I upgrade my version of R, many scripts will start breaking since R can’t
find required packages on my system. Then I have to go track down which packages
are missing in my new environment and install them manually. This can take a
long time, especially on systems where you must compile from source. I would
like to have all the same packages avialable to me that I had in my previous
version so that everything just works out of the box. What is the best way to do
that? I’m not sure, but I have whipped up a solution that has worked for me,
although it has its flaws.</p>

<h2 id="my-current-state-workflow">My Current-State Workflow</h2>

<p>Since the majority of the packages that I use are from CRAN, I have written an R
script that goes through a library location to identify and install CRAN packages
while telling me which packages I will need to install from elsewhere (<em>e.g.</em>,
<a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>,
<a href="http://www.omegahat.net/">Omegahat</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/SpectrumHealthResearch">github</a>,
internal and personal packages).</p>

<p>I still install non-CRAN pacakges manually, but it reduces the number of
packages that I have to process considerably. Installing non-CRAN packages could
be automated to a degree, but since packages are installed from so many
different places, I have not seen the benefit.</p>

<p>Here are the simple steps that I use:</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-library-path">Finding the Library Path</h3>

<p>Prior to installing a new version of R, I find out where my existing version of
R is searching to find its packages. These are the locations that I will be
coming back to in order to get a list of packages to build under my new version
of R. To do that, I use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.libPaths()</code> function.</p>

<p>In particular, the first element returned is my personal library (this
may also be defined by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R_LIBS_USER</code> environment variable). Unless you are a
site administrator, that is likely where the packages you want will be. I take
note of these locations, as I will need them in the next step.</p>

<h3 id="after-upgrade">After Upgrade</h3>

<p>Now that I have the location to the user library of my prior installation, I’m
ready to upgrade. Once I’ve have upgraded, I start an R session and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source()</code>
this file:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pegeler/9c45b7766bd70cd44836752dae3b4077.js"></script>

<p>The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install_packages_from_library()</code> takes a vector of library paths
to check and the dots (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code>) are passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install.packages()</code> so that I can
pass custom parameters such as a CRAN mirror or specify building from source.</p>

<p>An example usage would be:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install_packages_from_library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/home/user1/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I get one or two prompts and then package installation commences.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</h2>

<p>The internet is full of
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/upgrade-R.html">articles</a>,
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/automated-re-install-of-packages-for-r-3-0/">blog posts</a>,
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1401904/painless-way-to-install-a-new-version-of-r">Stack Overflow answers</a>,
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/67a9dh/how_do_you_migrate_your_packages_after_an_update/">forum posts</a>
on the subject.</p>

<p>A very popular answer seems to be to copy all packages from the old library
directory to the new one and then run
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)</code>
(note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkBuilt</code> parameter, which will cause the function to
upgrade packages built under a different version). This seems like a very
rational and convenient solution that would work for most cases. However, a
quick glance at the function documentation and source code indicates to me that
it does not solve the problem of packages from non-standard sources. As a
result, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update.packages()</code> approach risks moving packages into your new R
library that were built for the wrong version of R. Hence my reason for creating
the script above.</p>

<p>I still think there must to be a better way. How can I automate installation of
<em>all</em> packages in a library, not just CRAN packages? Also, is there a better way
to standardize my environment across workstations? For example, what do I do
when I move to a new machine which does not have access to those old package
libraries?</p>

<h3 id="metapackage-or-one-package-to-install-them-all">Metapackage, or One Package to Install Them All</h3>

<p>That got me thinking about the power of the packages themselves. Specifically,
metapackages, or packages that install/invoke other packages. A popular
metapackage that you probably already know is
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code></a>. So why not a
metapackage for personal use? Or even metapackages for specific use-cases?</p>

<p>With the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/vignettes/dependencies.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Remotes</code> field</a>
in a package <em>DESCRIPTION</em> file, even packages from non-standard sources can be
installed automatically with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devtools</code></a>.</p>

<p>So with that, I have created <a href="https://github.com/pegeler/metapackage">my first metapackage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There does not seem to be a clear consensus on exactly the right way to handle
package migration between versions of R. My previous workflow has served me well,
but I am looking forward to using my new metapackage in the future. We will soon
see how fastidous I am about updating packages that I begin using more or removing
those that fall by the wayside.</p>
