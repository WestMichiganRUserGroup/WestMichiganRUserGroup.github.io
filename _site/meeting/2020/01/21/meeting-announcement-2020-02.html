<h3 id="data-science-in-manufacturing-applications">Data Science in Manufacturing Applications</h3>

<p>Manufacturing has a rich history of using statistics in monitoring processes, quality control, and improve the manufacturing efficiencies. This gave a lead to manufacturing industries to use this data and leverage different levels of analytics to expand the scope to other applications. In this talk we will discuss how we turned our organization to a data-driven organization, by defining the five levels of analytics and how we used it to design our data science journey (or road map), setting up a team for a data science project, setting up data science infrastructure (R, Docker, Rancher), and a brief overview of various data science applications in manufacturing such as predictive maintenance, process quality prediction, quality control through vision AI, safety improvement using NLP, and NLP on historical maintenance records to define new projects. For each of the applications, we will discuss R packages used, the best method to automating R scripts, and the workflow between R and other applications. At the end of this talk, we will also discuss FAQ such as business decisions, deployment, auditing, and many as such.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h3>

<p>Dr. Nagdev Amruthnath currently works as Data Scientist III at DENSO North America.
